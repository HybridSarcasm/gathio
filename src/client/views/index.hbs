<p class="lead">A quick and easy way to make and share events which respects your privacy.</p>

<p>You don't need to sign up for an account. When you create an event, we generate a password which allows you to edit the event. Send all your guests the public link, and all your co-hosts the secret editing link containing the password. A week after the event finishes, it's deleted from our servers for ever, and your email goes with it.</p>

<div id="example-event" class="text-center w-100 mt-4 mb-5">
    <img src="images/example-event.png" class="img-fluid w-75 mx-auto shadow-lg rounded">
</div>

<p>Also, we don't show you ads, don't sell your data, and never send you unnecessary emails.</p>

<p>But remember: all our events are visible to anyone who knows the link, so
    probably don't use Gathio to plot your surprise birthday party or revolution. Or whatever, you do you.</p>
